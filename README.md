JavaScipt to break a nav menu

Working on a page with a horizontal nav menu where I don't know how many navigation items there are going to be, nor how long the individual items will be.  Was running into issues where it worked out that one or two lone items were getting pushed down to the next line and looked bad.

The idea of this script is to add up the total length of all of the navigation items, and if it exceeds the width of the window it splits it at about the 70% mark.
